Please log in to your Databricks account in the open browser window.

I have verified that the GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/databricks_sync.yml`) is already configured with the path you requested: `/Users/clokeshreddy@gmail.com/adventureworksanalytics`.

Once you are logged in, I will:
1.  Navigate to the `adventureworksanalytics` folder in your workspace.
2.  Start executing the notebooks cell-by-cell.
3.  If any errors occur, I will fix the code locally, push the changes to GitHub, verify the sync workflow, and then continue execution.

Let me know when you are logged in!
